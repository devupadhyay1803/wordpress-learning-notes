Notes and basic examples while learning PHP and WordPress fundamentals


I created this repository to understand:
- Basic PHP syntax and control structures
- How WordPress is structured internally
- The difference between themes and plugins
- The concept of actions and filters in WordPress

This is a learning-focused repository, and I plan to keep updating it as I explore backend development and WordPress further.
